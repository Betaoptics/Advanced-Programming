# Graphics Programming - TTOW0430

&nbsp;
## **Introduction**
Welcome to the Graphics Programming course. Goal is to learn how to program modern graphics accelerators using OpenGL programmable pipeline.

- Low level overview of the graphics programming
    - Hardware accelerated 3D graphics architecture
    - Double buffering, page flipping, pixel formats, depth and stencil buffers
- Understanding of how 3D geometry is constructed into vertices
- 3D transformations using vectors and matrices
- Scenegraph model
- Lighting models (gouraud, phong, blinn)
- Texturing, multitexturing and blending
- Advanced topics
    - Mapping techniques, Shadow mapping, Normal mapping, Cube mapping
    - GPU Instancing
    - Stencil testing

&nbsp;
## **Learning outcomes**
- Hardware accelerated graphics architecture
- Concepts of graphics application design and structure
- Ability to understand and write shaders programs
- Strenghten programming skills


&nbsp;
## **Tools and technologies**
- On windows, use Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
    - the free Community edition works just fine
    - Install support for C++ development
- All examples also contain standard makefiles for Linux environment
- Git Bash
    - Install with default settings

- OpenGL / OpenGL ES
- C++ and Visual Studio
- glm (open source library)
- stb (open source library)

- Course contents is applicable to
    - Desktop PCs (Windows/Linux)
    - Mobile devices (Android, iOS)

&nbsp;
## **Prerequirements**
- Basics in programming
- Operating systems
- Data structures and algorithms

### **Recommended**
- Object oriented programming (no language requirement)
- Understanding of linear algebra with vectors and matrices


&nbsp;
## **Materials**
- All course materials are in JAMK labranet GitLab service.
    - You will need JAMK labranet credentials to access the materials.
    - It is possible to use other Git service for your own repository.
- All materials are in English.
- All lessons are held on schedule as Teams meetings. Meetings are saved for later viewing. Participation to lessons voluntary but recommended.



&nbsp;
## **Assignments**
Course materials contain 10 home assignments and an exam.


&nbsp;
## Grading

Grading is based on 5 LAB exercises.

Each LAB exercise is worth 0 to 10 points, making maximum of 50 points.

| Points | Grade |
|:--------|:----------:|
| 0 - 10 | 0 |
| 11 - 18 | 1 |
| 19 - 26 | 2 |
| 27 - 34 | 3 |
| 35 - 42 | 4 |
| 43 - 50 | 5 |


&nbsp;
## Deliverables

Create and develop your LAB projects to JAMK GitLab environment.

Return LABs in zip file to Moodle return box.

**Final day to return the LABs: 14.12.2020**
